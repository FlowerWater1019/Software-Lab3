# Software Lab 3

In software lab3 I code a task arranger app, which has some basic functions such as Task List, Task Category and Task Timeline. Here is a quick start of it.

1. If there exists Anaconda in your PC, then just create a new environment and install packages needed.

```
    conda create --name taskapp python=3.10
    conda activate taskapp
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the command below and click the url that is output in the terminal. Note that the database of the repo will be generated under ./instance, and to initialize the db, we give three categories as "Work", "Personal" and "Study".

```
    python run.py
```
